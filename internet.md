The Internet is a global network of billions of computers and other electronic devices

## Basic Terms:
- **Packet:** A small unit of data that is transmitted over the internet.
- **Router:** A device that directs packets of data between different networks.
- **IP Address:** A unique identifier assigned to each device on a network, used to route data to the correct destination.
- **Domain Name:** A human-readable name that is used to identify a website, such as google.com.
- **DNS:** The Domain Name System is responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses.
- **HTTP:** The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is used to transfer data between a client (such as a web browser) and a server (such as a website).
- **HTTPS:** An encrypted version of HTTP that is used to provide secure communication between a client and server.

## The Role of Protocols in Internet:
A protocol is a set of rules and standards that define how information is exchanged between devices and systems.


## Types of protocols
### 1. Internet Protocol (IP)
### 2. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
### 3. User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
### 4. Hyper Text Transfer Protocol(HTTP)
- And so many more

### HTTP is the protocol used to transfer data between a client (such as a web browser) and a server (such as a website).

### HTTPS is a more secure version of HTTP, which encrypts the data being transmitted between the client and server using SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) encryption
